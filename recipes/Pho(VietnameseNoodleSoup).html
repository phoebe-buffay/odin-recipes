    <h2>
      This traditional pho recipe uses beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and
      ginger to create a delicious aromatic Vietnamese broth from scratch. The
      flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and
      topped with fresh garnishes.

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Beef Soup Bones: Use the shank and knee to make the homemade bone broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rice Noodles: You should be able to find dry rice noodles at most
        grocery stores, either in the international aisle or another pantry
        aisle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beef: This recipe calls for beef top sirloin. Make sure it's thinly
        sliced so the hot broth can cook it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fish Sauce: Fish sauce will give the pho a hint of salty, fishy flavor.
